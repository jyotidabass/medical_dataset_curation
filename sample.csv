3,the virostatic compound nndiethyloxotetradecylimidazolidinylethylpiperazinecarboxamidehydrochloride was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of tryptophanpyrrolase and tyrosineaminotransferase in rat liver the basic activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or in adrenalectomized animals the induction of the enzymes by cortisone increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction remained unchanged the induction of tyrosineaminotransferase by dexamethasonephosphate in TC is inhibited if the dose of compound is higher than mugml,66,tissue culture

5,a doubleblind study with intraindividual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of mg of ralphahydroxyisopropylalphahtropanium bromidetropate sch mg sch mg oxazepam mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume amount of acid concentration and ph values in healthy volunteers the secretion parameters were measured during a h basal period and a h stimulation period the gastric juice was obtained in min portions via stomach tube stimulation was effected by mugkgh pentagastrin via drip infusion the friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the wilcoxon test pairdifferences rank the results show that sch and sch oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume as compared with placebo it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam CT sch and sch oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first min of basal secretion none of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid although both sch preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values during the basal secretion period all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period the ph value was savely increased only by sch and sch oxazepam and this even only during the basal period the results are discussed,141,alone

14,the properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as builtinprobes of the structure of the protein we have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined the method may be applied to the side chain of histidine IMT lysine and cysteine as well as to the amino terminus of the protein the method which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using h and cfluorodinitrobenzene nphf in a doublelabeling procedure is rapid and sensitive advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein the method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme alphalytic protease and streptomyces griseus sg trypsin as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein the following parameters were obtained for reaction with nphf at degrees c in n kcl the histidine of hen eggwhite lysozyme pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the histidine of alphalytic protease pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the histidine of sg trypsin pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the valyl amino terminus of sg trypsin pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min in addition the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups and indicate that the proteins studied undergo phdependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups,53,tyrosine

21,the circular polarization of luminescence cpl emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligandinduced structural changes in a homogeneous type iii pneumococcal antibody a series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type iii polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed ligandinduced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested including tetra hexa and octasaccharides and a residue oligomer the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type iii pneumococcal siii polysaccharide when fab or fab fragments were used instead of the antibody igg for binding of siii polysaccharide the extent of conformational changes was decreased this suggests interactions between fab and fc portions in the igg molecule and subsequent conformational changes in fc part upon antigen IB reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the fc part but not the changes observed in the fab part thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal cpl changes to occur small monovalent ligands ie the tetra hexa and octasaccharides were capable of inducing cpl changes in the fab part of the antibody molecule as well as cpl changes attributed to the fc portion a multivalent ligand containing about sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the fc part similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen,134,binding
